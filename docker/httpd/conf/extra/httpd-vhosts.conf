# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.osaketen.com:80
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.osaketen\.com*
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ https://localhost/ [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>

#<VirtualHost *:81>
#    ServerName httpd-container:81
#    ProxyRequests Off
#    ProxyPass / http://osake-dev-container:8080/
#    ErrorLog /proc/self/fd/2
#    CustomLog /proc/self/fd/1 common
#</VirtualHost>
